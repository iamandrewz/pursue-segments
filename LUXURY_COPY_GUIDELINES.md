# Luxury Copy Guidelines for Pursue Segments

## Overview

This document establishes the luxury language standards for the Pursue Segments platform. Based on the Wisdom of Wrench "Luxury Language" episode principles, we differentiate our service from commodity competition through intentional word choice that creates emotional resonance and perceived value.

> *"When you name something, you have just differentiated it from the marketplace."* - Wisdom of Wrench

## The Salt Bag Concept

**Commodity (Salt Bag A vs Salt Bag B):**
When products have no differentiation, decisions come down to price alone. This is the commodity trap.

**Luxury Positioning:**
When you name your process and use elevated language, you create differentiation that transcends price competition. You're no longer selling a tool—you're providing a curated experience.

**Application to Pursue Segments:**
We don't provide "AI clips" or "automated editing." We offer **Curated Segment Selection** through our **Intelligent Analysis System**.

## Tone Guidelines

### ✅ DO

- **Use relationship-based language:** "client" not "customer" 
- **Speak to transformation:** Focus on results, not features
- **Emphasize craftsmanship:** Words like "curated," "crafted," "bespoke"
- **Signal exclusivity:** "Early access," "limited availability," "by invitation"
- **Use precision language:** "Accurate," "meticulous," "refined"
- **Frame value strategically:** "Investment," "partnership," "collaboration"
- **Name your processes:** Our "Intelligent Analysis Methodology"
- **Speak to emotions:** How clients feel after using the service

### ❌ DON'T

- **Never compete on speed alone:** "Fast" is a commodity attribute
- **Avoid technical jargon:** "AI," "machine learning," "algorithm" without context
- **Don't use transactional language:** "upload," "download," "tool"
- **Never mention price competition:** No "cheap," "affordable," "budget"
- **Avoid robotic terminology:** "Bot," "automated," "generated"
- **Don't be overly familiar:** Maintain professional distance
- **Never apologize for quality processes:** Don't say "sorry it takes time"

## The Three Things to Avoid

Per the Wisdom of Wrench episode, our competition talks about:
1. **Price**
2. **Brand** 
3. **Efficiency**

**We must avoid these same topics.** Instead, we emphasize:
1. **Quality & Craftsmanship**
2. **Exclusivity & Access**
3. **Transformation & Results**

## Examples: Good vs Bad Copy

### Landing Page Headline

❌ **BAD:** "AI-Powered Podcast Clip Generator"  
*Why: Commodity language, focuses on technology not transformation*

✅ **GOOD:** "Curated Segment Selection for Distinguished Podcasters"  
*Why: Implies selection/curation, positions for premium audience*

---

### CTA Button

❌ **BAD:** "Upload Your Video"  
*Why: Transactional, commodity language*

✅ **GOOD:** "Submit Your Episode"  
*Why: More refined, professional tone*

---

### Processing Status

❌ **BAD:** "AI is analyzing your video..."  
*Why: Robotic, technical focus*

✅ **GOOD:** "Our system is identifying key moments..."  
*Why: System-focused, implies curation of "moments" not just data*

---

### Results Page

❌ **BAD:** "We found 5 clips"  
*Why: Commodity finding, no value add implied*

✅ **GOOD:** "5 curated segments selected for your audience"  
*Why: Emphasizes curation and audience alignment*

---

### Feature Description

❌ **BAD:** "Our AI automatically generates clips from your podcast"  
*Why: Focuses on automation (cheap) and generation (mechanical)*

✅ **GOOD:** "Our intelligent system crafts bespoke segments tailored to engage your listeners"  
*Why: Emphasizes craftsmanship and audience engagement*

## Naming Your Process

Per luxury language principles, **naming your process creates differentiation**:

| Generic Term | Our Luxury Name |
|-------------|----------------|
| AI Analysis | The Pursue Method™ |
| Transcription | Dialogue Analysis |
| Clip Finding | Moment Curation |
| Processing Pipeline | Content Refinement Journey |
| Results | Your Curated Collection |

## Implementation Notes

### For Team Members:

1. **Commit as a team** - Everyone must use the luxury language
2. **Hold each other accountable** - Gently correct commodity language
3. **Practice consistently** - It takes time to change habituated language
4. **Get permission first** - When correcting colleagues, ask "Do you mind if I point that out?"

### For External Communications:

1. **Review all copy** against this guideline before publishing
2. **Read aloud** - Does it sound like a luxury service or a tech tool?
3. **Check for commodity words** - Scan for "AI," "automated," "fast," "cheap," "tool"
4. **Emphasize feelings** - How will the client feel after using our service?
